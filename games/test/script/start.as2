This is the phrase right before the choice \i


! choice text = "This is the choice text"; ch1 = "This is the first choice"; go1 = {choice1}; ch2 = "This is the second choice"; go2 = {choice2}; ch3 = "leave this hell"; go3 = {leave}; flag3=%haveSeen2
#!! ch1 = "This is the first choice"; go1 = {choice1};
#!! ch2 = "This is the second choice"; go2 = {choice2};
#!! ch3 = "leave this hell"; go3 = {leave}; flag3=%haveSeen2

{choice1}
This is the text for the first choice \i
! flag haveSeen1=True
! goto pos=4

{choice2}
! checkflag flag="haveSeen1"; gotrue = {choice2_yes}; gofalse = {choice2_no}

{choice2_no}
You haven't seen the first choice! \i
! goto pos=4

{choice2_yes}
! flag haveSeen2=True
This is the text for the second choice \i
! goto pos=4

# Didn't bother to properly edit the gotos
{leave}
! checkflag flag="haveSeen1"; gotrue = 29; gofalse = 30
! checkflag flag="haveSeen2"; gofalse = 30; gotrue = 33
You haven't seen both choices!
Unless flags hasn't been added, there has to be an error somewhere... \i
! goto pos=4
#! loadscript "test_cont"
! ending name="the end"
