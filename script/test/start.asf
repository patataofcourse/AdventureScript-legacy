[choice text = "This is the choice text"; ch1 = "This is the first choice"; go1 = 5; ch2 = "This is the second choice"; go2 = 8; ch3 = "leave this hell"; go3 = 14; flags="{3:haveSeen2}"]
This is the text for the first choice [n]
[flag haveSeen1 = True]
[goto pos = 4]
[checkflag flag = "haveSeen1"; gotrue = 11; gofalse = 9]
You haven't seen the first choice! [n]
[goto pos = 4]
[flag haveSeen2 = True]
{test} This is the text for the second choice [n]
[goto pos = 4]
[checkflag flag = "haveSeen1"; gotrue = 15; gofalse = 16]
[checkflag flag = "haveSeen2"; gofalse = 16; gotrue = 19]
You haven't seen both choices!
Unless flags hasn't been added, there has to be an error somewhere... [n]
[goto pos = 4]
