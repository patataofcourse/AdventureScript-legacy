# AdventureScript
## This library is being rewritten in Rust at https://github.com/patataofcourse/AdventureScript2
### If all goes as planned, AdventureScript 2 will only release in Rust
AdventureScript is a text game engine in progress, made specifically for the game codenamed Yet Another Text Game or YATG, and written in Python. It's meant to be imported as a library and can be used asynchronously.

(There's a more detailed version of this README in readme_old.md, but it's severely outdated. I'll fix it up a bit for the next release.)
