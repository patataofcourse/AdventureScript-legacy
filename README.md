# AdventureScript
AdventureScript is a text game engine in progress, made specifically for the game codenamed Yet Another Text Game or YATG, and written in Python. It's meant to be imported as a library and can be used asynchronously.

**WARNING: IT'S NOT MEANT TO BE USED BY OTHERS AS OF RN. WILL TRY TO CLEAN UP FOR 2.0**

(There's a more detailed version of this README in readme_old.md, but it's severely outdated. I'll fix it up a bit for the next release.)
