# AdventureScript - legacy 1.x versions
[AdventureScript 2.0 onwards available here](https://github.com/patataofcourse/AdventureScript)

## What is this repo?
This repository contains the old Python code for AdventureScript, before 2.0.

Needless to say, these versions are completely unsupported. You're free to try to port 2.0 to Python for some reason, but Rust is just objectively better for this stuff.

## Branches
The `main` branch contains some of the changes I was going to introduce for v2.0, but I've decided to make the default branch (this) actually stable.

You can also find some progress on RNG stuff on the `random` branch. I'll probably add it to AdventureScript on 2.1 or 2.2, though.

## Rant about why this repo is abandoned and why it's still here
Between the failure of [AdventureGUI](https://github.com/patataofcourse/AdventureGUI) (due to me not liking pyglet or pygame), and AdventureScript growing more and more past its original scope, Python doesn't cut it anymore.

2.0 was already going to happen, to introduce huge breaking changes in formatting scripts, but me learning Rust has lead to wanting to better this project even more.

I don't suggest you try to adapt this code to 2.0. It's fundamentally flawed in many aspects and needs to be completely remade in some senses.

Still, it was my first successful big project, and I'm glad I'm not saying goodbye to AdventureScript 1.0 because it's been abandoned, but because it's going to grow into a much better form. So I want to keep this repo here.
